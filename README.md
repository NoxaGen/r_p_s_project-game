Welcome in one of my first projects, the project is very small and simple but i want to use some techniques i have learn in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

Rock Paper Scissors game is working on the browsers and it fully responsive on all devices with diffrent resolution.

Firstable i was think, the method to creating from "Desktop to Mobile" will be better but now i think its not. My next projects will definetly
go from "Mobile to Desktop".

Please remember this project is created by newbie and i know many things can be done much better, but i prefer do something myself 
against copy someones work.

Every advice and feedback are welcome and enjoy playing the game :)
